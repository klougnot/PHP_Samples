CREATE TABLE test1 (
       id INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
       image MEDIUMBLOB NOT NULL,
       PRIMARY KEY (id) 
  
       );

ALTER TABLE images ENGINE = InnoDB;

If using mysqli prepared statements you must set the table to InnoDB in order for the prepared statements to execute. 
If using bluehost you will need to go into phpMYadmin and set this value manually by clicking on table option, selecting InnoDb 
from the drop down and clicking the go button.
